# STATUS.md — current state & open findings

_Point-in-time summary, last updated **2026-07-20**. Update this file whenever
findings are fixed or new ones land (same-change discipline as AGENTS.md §10).

CAPABILITIES.md._

## Where the repo stands

| Aspect | State |
|---|---|
| Ports | 94 / **403 in-scope** `sap.m` samples (23.3 %) — in scope = control exists since UI5 1.71 and is not deprecated; 43 of 446 samples are out of scope (16 deprecated, 21 newer, 6 without control metadata) |
| CI | ABAP_STANDARD, ABAP_CLOUD, ABAP_702 all green |
| Structural view diff | **0 undeclared differences** across all 64 ports (`node scripts/structural-diff.mjs --strict`) — including simple **binding values** and, since 2026-07-19, **`id` attributes** (name-level per control type; dropped original ids must be restored or declared) |
| Render smoke | **0 failing / 1 skipped** (`npm run smoke`): every reconstructable port's view loads in a real headless `XMLView.create`; app 049's skip is now a **declared, CI-enforced** `render_smoke.skip` (helper-method view building is not statically reconstructable — an undeclared non-reconstructable port now FAILS); harness carries `sap.f` and mocks scalar-row tables as empty arrays since b05 |
| Pattern lint | **0 errors, 0 warnings, empty baseline** (`node scripts/pattern-lint.mjs`) |
| Meta sidecars | 67 in `meta/` — status: 21 `generated`, 41 `checked`, **5 `golden`** (401, 421, 454, 540, 543 — promoted 2026-07-20 after the full live check); deviations: 39 IMPROVISED, 34 POST_171, 81 NOTE, 3 DROPPED_171 (the `p:ColumnAIAction` plugin in apps 009/022/534 — a whole control newer than 1.71, unlike the restorable members). **0 LIVE_TEST** (b07/b08 menu + message-popover paths live-checked 2026-07-22) and **0 SUBSET_DATA** (retired 2026-07-22 — every port now inlines the full mock row set). `audit` is a structured object since 2026-07-18 |
| Manually verified in a running system | **46 of 67 ports** — adds 060/061/066/067 (menu + MessagePopover, human live check 2026-07-22) to the 2026-07-20 checked set; the 21 remaining `generated` ports are b01–b04 apps that never carried an open question (machine-verified only) |
| Archive | `ui5/sap.m/<SampleName>/` — full originals for the 44 ported samples (+2 cross-referenced: `FacetFilterSimple`, `Table`); mock snapshot in `ui5/mock/`. Unported samples are copied over batch by batch. |

## Live-check fixes on b09–b11 (2026-07-22) + three new pr requests

Human live check surfaced six runtime issues (machine checks can't see them);
all fixed, all six checks still green:

- **094** — the popover's Action button used `cs_event-popup_close` (destroys
  the `POPUP` slot), so a `POPOVER` never closed → **`cs_event-popover_close`**.
- **080** — `${$source>/pressed}` did not resolve at runtime; the source id +
  pressed state now arrive via **`$event.oSource.sId`** and
  **`$event.oSource.getPressed()`** (the proven `$event.oSource.*` path).
- **092** — the `Slider.liveChange` / `MultiComboBox.selectionFinish` server
  round-trips returned an empty response and **blanked the view**; both were
  dropped at the time. **Superseded 2026-07-22**: `selectionFinish` is now wired
  1:1 through the new `setHiddenInPopin` control method (see the framework
  section below); only the `Slider.liveChange` (`setWidth`) stays inert.
  `popinChanged` still toasts.
- **085** — the first Tokenizer's tokens are now **model-bound** (`t_tokens`);
  add appends, delete removes by key (`$event.getParameter('tokens')[0].getKey()`).
- **081** — the incremental backend load is now reproduced 1:1 (start with one
  product, each pull appends the next via `fill_all` + a `shown` counter) instead
  of binding the full 123 up front.
- **084** — fixed with the real **`URLHELPER`** frontend action
  (`cs_event-urlhelper`): `TRIGGER_TEL`/`TRIGGER_SMS` take the number as a plain
  string param, `TRIGGER_EMAIL`/`REDIRECT` a `{ EMAIL/URL, … }` object-literal
  `t_arg` (`get_t_arg` emits `{`-prefixed args raw as UI5 event-handler object
  literals). An earlier claim that URLHELPER had "no ABAP path" was **wrong** —
  it is callable; the withdrawn `urlhelper-abap-api` pr is recorded in
  `pr/README` Declined. **`open_new_tab` is same-origin-only** (`isValidRedirectURL`),
  so it can't open external sites/`tel:`/`mailto:` — the external links in apps
  **041/073** were switched from `open_new_tab` to `urlhelper` REDIRECT
  (correctness fix), and CAPABILITIES.md updated.

Both **`pr/`** requests from the checks —
[`table-hidden-in-popin`](../pr/table-hidden-in-popin/) (092) and
[`popover-bind-element`](../pr/popover-bind-element/) (094) — are now
**implemented** in the framework (see the next section).

## Framework features implemented (2026-07-22) — `setHiddenInPopin` + `BIND_ELEMENT`

Both were carried into abap2UI5 (branch `claude/ai-demokit-edge-cases-ftv30b`)
and the two demokit apps rewired to use them:

- **`setHiddenInPopin`** — new `sap.m.Table` entry in `CONTROL_METHODS`
  (`["object"]`), in both `app/webapp/core/FrontendAction.js` and the ABAP
  generator mirror `z2ui5_cl_app_frontendaction_js`. **App 092** now reproduces
  `onSelectionFinish` 1:1: the `MultiComboBox` `selectedKeys` are two-way bound
  to `t_hidden`, and `selectionFinish` forwards them as a JSON Priority array via
  `follow_up_action( cs_event-control_by_id, setHiddenInPopin )`.
- **`BIND_ELEMENT`** — new `cs_event-bind_element` constant + `evBindElement`
  action (both JS files) + brace-stripping arg formatting in
  `get_event_client`, so a whole view slot can be element-bound to a table row
  through `follow_up_action`. **App 094** now reproduces the original
  `oPopover.bindElement(...)`: the popover uses relative bindings
  (`{PRODUCT_ID}` / `{NAME}` / `{PRODUCT_PIC_URL}`) and
  `follow_up_action( val = cs_event-bind_element, view = cs_view-popover,
  t_arg = VALUE #( ( idx ) ( client->_bind( t_products ) ) ) )` binds the
  popover slot to `t_products/<index>`, the index taken from the pressed row's
  binding context. 3 node tests added (29 pass, abaplint clean).

Both apps stay machine-green (abaplint against the updated framework,
validate-meta, pattern-lint, structural-diff `--strict`, property-check,
render-smoke `--strict` — 094 now renders 2 docs incl. the popover). Their
sidecars' `IMPROVISED` deviations were rewritten from "dropped/inert" to the
faithful wiring. **LIVE-TEST pending** on both.

## Overview: always-shown Audit column (2026-07-22)

The overview table gained an **Audit** column (`scripts/generate-overview.mjs`,
computed from each port's ABAP source at generation time, always visible). One
badge per framework-wiring fact the port uses: `_event_client` (9 apps) and its
`t_arg` form (3), `follow_up_action` (14) and its `t_arg` form (14), opens a
`Popup` (8) or `Popover` (1), and **literal binding** (40) — a path written by
name in clear text (`{FIELD}` / `{/Path}`) instead of via `client->_bind`, the
form that breaks on a variable rename.

## Overview overhaul (2026-07-22) — releases, filters, Shell, split Open

Further reworked `scripts/generate-overview.mjs` (all offline, baked into the
generated class at generation time):

- **Title** now carries the ported-app count — `abap2UI5 Demo Kit (94)`.
- **Release column** (next to Sample): the direct UI5 release the whole *sample*
  needs = the control `since` raised by any kept post-1.71 member (parsed from the
  POST_171 deviation texts); blank = available since forever. The existing
  **Since** column keeps showing the *control's* own since (next to Control).
- **Deviation** rescaled 1→10 (`min(10, 1 + weighted deviations)`) and **no longer
  coloured** (plain text).
- **UI5 only column**: badges rows whose control is not part of OpenUI5. The
  membership oracle is `ui5/properties.json` ∪ `@openui5` source module (`.js`) ∪
  library.js / .library mentions — so statics (URLHelper) and CSS-class doc
  entities (StandardMargins/ContainerPadding) count as OpenUI5; only the two
  demo-kit-only composite *Pattern* samples (012/013) flag `ui5_only` (2).
- **Header filter checkboxes** (default all on), filtering the table entirely on
  the client via each row's `visible` expression (no round-trip): Hide non-OpenUI5,
  Hide newer than 1.71 (2020) (28 apps), Hide deprecated (0). Disabled while the
  tree is shown.
- **Shell switch** (next to Tree view) toggles the `sap.m.Shell` letterboxing
  (`appWidthLimited`), two-way bound, client-side.
- **Open column split into two buttons**: the first starts the abap2UI5 app
  directly in a new tab (`cs_event-open_new_tab` via `_event_client` — the start
  URL is same-origin, so it passes `isValidRedirectURL`); the second opens the
  reference-links popover, now trimmed to the four external links (OpenUI5 API,
  source, live sample, ABAP class). The same two buttons sit on every tree leaf.

Follow-up refinements (2026-07-22): the **Release** column is renamed **Since**
and only shows a value when higher than the control's own since (otherwise it
just repeats it); **both Since columns are sortable and coloured orange**
(`ObjectStatus` Warning via a `{= … ? 'Warning' : 'None' }` expression) when newer
than 1.71. **UI5 only → Version** (still the orange SAPUI5 badge). The **Note
column is removed**; its info (checked status, post-1.71 note, generation notes)
moved **into the links popover**, which also carries the four reference links. The
two Open buttons are **swapped** (links-popover first, app-launch second), on the
table and the tree. The `Tree`-nested-in-`Table` startup crash from the first cut
is fixed (missing `shut()` restored). The popover's generation notes render as an
**HTML bullet list** (`FormattedText`, one `<li>` per bullet, the type label in
bold; the note text is HTML-escaped, then the builder's `xml_escape` + UI5's
single un-escape show it verbatim). The **sample-since version parser** was fixed:
it now takes the max of *all* version tokens in the POST_171 texts (the old
`since X.Y` regex missed the common `since UI5 1.84` phrasing, so the column was
nearly always blank); 28 rows now carry a sample-since (matching the 28 post-1.71
ports).

## Batch b11 generated (2026-07-22) — pages, pickers, tables & popovers (7 ports)

Classes **088–094**, breadth-first NEW-CONTROL: 088 StandardMarginsAll
(`sap.ui.core.StandardMargins`), 089 PageStandardClasses (`sap.m.Page`),
090 DialogSearch (`sap.m.SearchField`), 091 TimePickerHidden (`sap.m.TimePicker`),
092 TableAutoPopin (`sap.m.Table`), 093 TabContainer, 094
PopoverControllingCloseBehavior (`sap.m.Popover`). Machine-verified green
(abaplint, validate-meta, pattern-lint, structural-diff `--strict`,
property-check, render-smoke `--strict`); status `generated`.

Notables: **091** reuses the app-016 openBy pattern (source `sId` via
`$event.oSource.sId` → `control_by_id`/`openBy` follow-up); **092** keeps the
declarative `autoPopinMode` + `Column.importance` 1:1 (the imperative
setWidth/setHiddenInPopin handlers dropped) and reuses the curated
`Formatter.weightState`; **090** and **094** build their dialog/popover via
`popup_display`/`popover_display` in `on_event` (094 passes the row values as
event args and anchors by `sId`). **This batch is 7 ports, not 10**: the three
remaining backlog-top controls were **deferred** as too lossy for a 1:1 port
(AGENTS §5) — **SemanticPage** (semantic-page landmark aggregations),
**QuickView/QuickViewCard** (multi-page card navigation + navOrigin), and
**ViewSettingsDialog** (custom sort/filter/group tabs). They stay NEW-CONTROL in
the backlog for a dedicated effort, alongside the calendar family
(PlanningCalendar / SinglePlanningCalendar) and SplitApp/SplitContainer that now
dominate the backlog top.

## Batch b10 generated (2026-07-22) — toolbars, tiles & lists (10 ports)

Classes **078–087**, breadth-first NEW-CONTROL: 078 TileContent,
079 TitleLink (`sap.m.Title`), 080 ToggleButton, 081 PullToRefresh,
082 SlideTile, 083 StandardListItemAvatar (`sap.m.StandardListItem`),
084 UrlHelper (`sap.m.URLHelper`), 085 TokenizerBasic (`sap.m.Tokenizer`),
086 ToolbarDesign (`sap.m.OverflowToolbar`), 087 ContainerNoPadding
(`sap.ui.core.ContainerPadding`, an IconTabBar demo). Machine-verified green
(abaplint, validate-meta, pattern-lint, structural-diff `--strict`,
property-check, render-smoke `--strict`); status `generated`.

Notables: **083** keeps the original's `{/ProductCollection}` List element
binding + `{0/Name}..{3/Name}` index item bindings against the full 123-row
default-model table; **084** flattens `/SupplierCollection/0` to a `/S_SUPPLIER`
record and maps the URLHelper tel/sms/email triggers to toasts (website →
open_new_tab); **086** turns the Select `change` design/style handlers into
two-way binds + an expression-binding `visible`; **087** flattens the
`/ProductCollectionStats/Counts` to `/TOTAL /OK /HEAVY /OVERWEIGHT`.
The two heaviest OverflowToolbar samples (OverflowToolbarFooter, full table +
menu; OverflowToolbarTokenizer, many tokenizers + DateTimePicker/SegmentedButton)
were left in the backlog for a dedicated effort rather than forced in.

## Batch b09 generated (2026-07-22) — objects, inputs & notifications (10 ports)

The next 10 backlog-top NEW-CONTROL samples, breadth-first (one port per
uncovered control), classes **068–077**: 068 Slider, 069 RadioButton,
070 ProgressIndicator, 071 ObjectIdentifier, 072 ObjectNumber,
073 ObjectAttributes (`sap.m.ObjectAttribute`), 074 ObjectListItem,
075 SelectList, 076 NotificationListItem, 077 NotificationListGroup.
Machine-verified to green (abaplint ×STANDARD, validate-meta, pattern-lint,
structural-diff `--strict`, property-check, render-smoke `--strict`). Status
`generated` (no human live check yet).

Notables: the list ports (**074**, **075**) inline the full 123-row mock
per the 2026-07-22 no-subset rule; **074** precomputes the `.formatter.status`
ValueState into a `STATUS_STATE` field (the app-038/545 pattern). The
single-record display ports (**071**, **073**) reproduce the original's
`{/ProductCollection/0}` element binding as a one-record `/S_PRODUCT` structure
(the 041 pattern); **072** carries records 0–5 as a 6-row table and
element-binds each ObjectNumber to `/T_PRODUCTS/0..5` (index binding, inlined
`_bind` per control). **070**'s two interactive ProgressIndicators are set via
two-way bound percentValue/displayValue + a SET event (replacing the
controller's byId setters). New POST_171 firsts: `RadioButton.wrapping`/
`wrappingType` (1.126), `ProgressIndicator.displayAnimation` (1.73),
`ObjectNumber.inverted`/`active`/`press` (1.86), `ObjectAttribute.ariaHasPopup`
(1.97). The notification ports are static declarations (close's client-side
`removeItem` is not mirrored → toast; declared). Open LIVE_TESTs (machine-only):
the `${$source>/title}` event args (076/077), the interactive PI SET round-trip
(070), the feedback popup + open_new_tab (073), the ObjectNumber index bindings
(072).

## Full mock data + deviation score (2026-07-22)

Two user decisions this day:

- **No more data subsetting.** The nine `SUBSET_DATA` ports were rebuilt to
  inline the **full mock row set** (all 123 `/ProductCollection` rows of
  `ui5/mock/products.json`), byte-identical to the mock: **006, 030, 033, 034,
  039, 040** (product lists), **012** (all 123 rows loaded, the table binding
  still filters to `Category = Laptops` as the original does client-side; `price`
  bumped to `DECIMALS 2` so the 19 non-integer prices stay exact) and **022**
  (full products + the precomputed `/ProductCollectionStats/Filters` counters —
  16 categories / 12 suppliers — which is what the original binds). **041** keeps
  its single `/ProductCollection/0` binding (that is the original's own
  single-record binding, not a subset) — its tag was relabelled `NOTE`. The
  `SUBSET_DATA` deviation type is **retired**: `validate-meta` now rejects it and
  `AGENTS.md §model_init` requires the full row set. All checks stay green
  (abaplint, structural-diff `--strict`, validate-meta, pattern-lint,
  property-check, render-smoke `--strict`).
- **Rating (1–5) in the overview app.** A sortable **Rating** column in
  `z2ui5_cl_ai_app_overview` scores, "by feel", how much attention a port
  deserves — not a strict deviation count. Four things push it up (all
  additive): **complexity** (a big view / rich interaction — LOC, `_event*`/
  `follow_up_action` count, control count), **rework** (every non-1:1
  substitution `IMPROVISED`/`DROPPED_171`/`SUBSET_DATA` or documented `NOTE`
  subtlety), **discussed** (a port reviewed together — it carries a `checked`
  block), and **test-priority** (pending `LIVE_TEST`s, roundtrip-free/runtime
  wiring, popups/popovers, a needs-newer-than-1.71 render). `score =
  min(5, max(1, round(1 + Σweights)))`; 1 = simple faithful 1:1, 5 = complex /
  reworked / worth a close look. Sort descending to find the samples worth a
  closer manual look. Computed in `scripts/generate-overview.mjs`. Current
  spread: **6×1, 32×2, 24×3, 15×4, 17×5** (was briefly rescaled to 1–10, taken
  back to 1–5 with the richer heuristic on user request 2026-07-22).
- **Four LIVE_TESTs closed.** 060 Menu, 061 MenuButton, 066 MessagePopover,
  067 MessagePopoverAsync were human live-checked (open/toggle + item paths) and
  promoted `generated → checked`; their `LIVE_TEST` entries became live-verified
  `NOTE`s. (Later that day the client-composed-toast conversions — 005, 060, 061,
  077, see below — re-opened a few `LIVE_TEST`s for the new roundtrip-free
  mechanism.)

## Client-composed toasts (2026-07-22)

The abap2UI5 branch gained `pr/message-toast-format`: a `control_global`
single-string method (`MessageToast.show`, `MessageBox.*`) composes its text
from a template + client-resolved args (`{0}`,`{1}`,… filled by `$event.*` /
`${$parameters>/…}`), so a **dynamic** toast is roundtrip-free — 1:1 with the
demo-kit `MessageToast.show("…" + evt.…)`. `get_t_arg` quotes a leading `{0}`
placeholder so a value-first template survives; a lone string is unchanged.
Ports **005** (Button, 12 presses), **060** (Menu), **061** (MenuButton) and
**077** (NotificationListGroup) converted — each loses its `on_event` entirely
and becomes **init-only**. Toasts whose text is computed server-side (019, 024,
…) correctly keep their round-trip. All gates green; the four converted ports
carry a `LIVE_TEST` for the new mechanism.

## control_by_id view-slot fix + golden category retired (2026-07-22)

- **Runtime bug fixed.** After the framework moved the view to its own `view`
  parameter (`get_event_client` inserts it at `t_arg` index 2 for
  `control_by_id`), the ports that still carried an explicit empty `( `` )` view
  slot ended up with `[id, '', '', method, …]`, so the frontend read
  `method = ''` and logged `CONTROL_BY_ID: method '' not allowed` (openBy/
  toggleBy never fired). Dropped the empty slot in **060, 065, 066, 067, 091**
  and in the overview generator's tree Expand-all/Collapse-all buttons; correct
  form is `( id ) ( method ) ( params )`. New pattern-lint rule
  `control-by-id-empty-view-slot` guards it.
- **`golden` status retired** (user decision — "erstmal keine golden kategorie").
  The five golden ports (007, 016, 019, 022, 040) are now plain `checked`;
  `validate-meta` drops `golden` from the status vocabulary; the overview
  generator drops the `golden` flag (it fed only the rating's "discussed"
  signal, now `checked`-only); AGENTS.md / TRAINING.md updated. Former golden
  ports may now be refactored to the current conventions like any other.

## Batches

The 34 existing ports are retro-grouped into review batches — one subpackage
`src/01/b<nn>` = one ABAP package = one review unit (recorded per port in
`meta/<class>.json` as `batch`):

| Batch | Theme | Apps | Live-checked |
|---|---|---|---|
| `b01` | Display & navigation | 408, 409, 431, 434, 440, 460, 529, 530 | 431, 434, 440, 460, 529, 530 |
| `b02` | Selection & input | 421, 422, 423, 439, 452, 454, 472, 481, 527, 528 | 421, 452, 454 |
| `b03` | Actions, toolbars & popups | 447, 448, 449, 469, 474, 486, 526 | 469, 474, 486, 526 |
| `b04` | Layout, lists & data | 401, 404, 420, 433, 441, 445, 471, 473, 487 | 401, 404, 420, 433, 471, 473, 487 |
| `b05` | Backlog top: bars, tables, custom items & patterns | 531, 532, 533, 534, 535, 536, 537, 538, 539, 540 | all (2026-07-20) |
| `b06` | Date pickers, dialogs, feeds & tiles | 541, 542, 543, 544, 545, 546, 547, 548, 549, 550 | all (2026-07-20) |
| `b07` | Icon tabs, tile content, menus, list items & message strips | IconTabHeader, ImageContent, InputListItem, LabelProperties, LightBox, Menu, MenuButton, MessageStrip, NewsContent, NumericContent (classes 055–064) | — (machine-verified only) |
| `b08` | Message popover (all three MessagePopover samples) | MessagePopoverMessageHandling (065), MessagePopover (066), MessagePopoverAsyncMessageHandling (067) | 065–067 (2026-07-22) |
| `b09` | Objects, inputs & notifications | Slider, RadioButton, ProgressIndicator, ObjectIdentifier, ObjectNumber, ObjectAttributes, ObjectListItem, SelectList, NotificationListItem, NotificationListGroup (classes 068–077) | — (machine-verified only) |
| `b10` | Toolbars, tiles & lists | TileContent, TitleLink, ToggleButton, PullToRefresh, SlideTile, StandardListItemAvatar, UrlHelper, TokenizerBasic, ToolbarDesign, ContainerNoPadding (classes 078–087) | — (machine-verified only) |
| `b11` | Pages, pickers, tables & popovers | StandardMarginsAll, PageStandardClasses, DialogSearch, TimePickerHidden, TableAutoPopin, TabContainer, PopoverControllingCloseBehavior (classes 088–094) | — (machine-verified only) |

New generation batches continue as `b08`, `b09`, … per the process in
TRAINING.md.

## Batch b08 generated (2026-07-20) — the whole MessagePopover family (3 ports)

All three `sap.m.MessagePopover` demo-kit samples, so the control has no
ambiguous representative. To port the canonical simple one, **`sap.m.sample.
MessagePopover` was taken out of the hold-out set** (`ui5/holdout.json`,
25 → 24; user decision 2026-07-20) — it is the clean base demo, so it earns a
port rather than staying a regression reference.

- **066 MessagePopover** (base) — the canonical demo: an empty Page + a footer
  button that toggles a MessagePopover listing five static messages
  (Error/Warning/Success/Error/Information) with a MessageItem `link`. The
  MessagePopover (built in the sample's controller) is declared in the button's
  `dependents`; `oMessagePopover.toggle(button)` becomes the new `toggleBy`
  frontend action anchored to `$event.oSource.sId`; the three severity
  formatters (icon/type/count) are precomputed from the static mock. app-038
  plain-table shape — no cc, no `message>` needed.
- **067 MessagePopoverAsyncMessageHandling** — same shape with
  `markupDescription=true` and an HTML-rich first message; the controller's
  `setAsyncURLHandler` (client-side async URL validation) has no equivalent and
  is dropped (declared).
- **065 MessagePopoverMessageHandling** — the message-model app, ported on a
  **new `z2ui5.cc.MessageManager`** companion control (abap2UI5, this branch)
  that bridges the UI5 message manager to a two-way bound ABAP table:
  app-authored messages (`items`) are reconciled into the manager with a target
  + the view's model as processor (field valueState), while binding-type/
  constraint validation still auto-collects into `message>`. The cc mirrors the
  MultiInputExt pattern, is unit-tested (add/dedup/remove-own/leave-foreign/
  defer) and in the preload. So the earlier "message-manager-binding already
  covered" note was only half-right: reading was covered by `message>`,
  **writing** needed this cc. Port: two forms bound to `/T_FORMS` (3-row
  subset) + `/T_EMPLOYMENT` with typed value bindings + constraints
  (auto-collection), MessagePopover on `{message>/}`, the cc on `/T_MESSAGES`,
  Save authors a demo message. Controller-only severity/group/scroll/
  CommandExecution dropped (declared).

All three machine-verified green (abaplint STANDARD+CLOUD, validate-meta,
pattern-lint, structural-diff `--strict`, render-smoke `--strict` with a new
`z2ui5.cc.MessageManager` harness mirror + empty `message>` model,
property-check). The message-manager runtime (065's auto-collection + cc
reconcile + valueState; the toggleBy toggle; activeTitlePress) stays LIVE_TEST
— unverifiable headlessly. Render-smoke bugs fixed while porting 065: a missing
Button-closing `shut` (MessagePopover leaked as a direct Button child), the
email regex needing `\\`-escaped backslashes for the binding parser, and
`DATA … TYPE <named-table-type>` not recognised as a table by the
reconstructor (switched to inline `STANDARD TABLE OF`, the AGENTS §5
convention).

## Batch b07 generated (2026-07-20)

The next 10 backlog-top NEW-CONTROL samples, breadth-first (one port per
uncovered control), classes **055–064**: 055 IconTabHeader, 056 ImageContent,
057 InputListItem, 058 LabelProperties (`sap.m.Label`), 059 LightBox,
060 Menu, 061 MenuButton, 062 MessageStripWithEnableFormattedText,
063 NewsContent, 064 NumericContentIcon. Machine-verified to green
(abaplint ×STANDARD+CLOUD, validate-meta, pattern-lint, structural-diff
`--strict`, render-smoke `--strict`, property-check). Adversarial AI review
(2 reviewers × 5 apps): **9 CLEAN, 1 MINOR, 0 MAJOR** — the MINOR was app 060's
press handler dropping the sample's toggle (close-if-open) branch; the menu's
open/closed state lives client-side and is not reliably mirrorable
server-side, so the port always (re-)opens and the reduction is now declared
in the sidecar.

Three controls at the top of the backlog were **deferred** rather than forced
into a lossy 1:1 (AGENTS §5 "if the sample's whole point needs an
inexpressible feature, do not port it"): **InitialPagePattern** (an
app-level pattern — seven fragments, value-help dialog, IllustratedMessage,
client filtering), **InputModelUpdate** (its whole point is oData v2 late
binding via `bindElement`/`dataReceived`, and abap2UI5 serves a single
default model), and **MessagePopoverMessageHandling** (built on the UI5
MessageManager / message model). They stay `NEW-CONTROL` in the backlog for a
later dedicated effort.

Techniques worth noting: **060 Menu** reuses the app-016 openBy
frontend action — the Menu is declared in the Button's `dependents`
aggregation and opened via `control_by_id`/`openBy` anchored to
`$event.oSource.sId`. **058 LabelProperties** is roundtrip-free: the four
controller handlers become two-way `state` binds (displayOnly/wrapping) plus
`{= }` expression bindings (`wrappingType = hyphenation ? 'Hyphenated' :
'Normal'`, container `width = slider_value + '%'`), the app-007 pattern.
**062 MessageStrip** keeps the post-1.71 `controls` multi-link aggregation
(1.129, declared) and the `enableFormattedText` HTML strips. New POST_171
firsts this batch: `Button.ariaHasPopup` (1.84, app 060),
`MenuButton.beforeMenuOpen` (1.94, app 061), `MessageStrip.controls` (1.129,
app 062). The b07 ports are `generated` (no human live check yet); the menu
item-arg paths (`${$parameters>/item/text}`) and the openBy anchoring are the
open LIVE_TESTs.

**Framework gaps from b07 — two implemented upstream, one deferred:**
- **`menu-toggle-openby` → implemented 2026-07-20**: `toggleBy: ["domRef"]`
  added to `CONTROL_METHODS` (`control.isOpen() ? close() : openBy(anchor)`,
  no server-side open state). App 060 converted openBy→toggleBy — the
  press-to-toggle menu is now 1:1 (the IMPROVISED toggle-reduction is gone).
  Framework unit tests added.
- **`formatter-inline-icon` → implemented 2026-07-20**: `expandInlineIcons`
  added to the curated `model/formatter.js` (replaces `%%icon:sap-icon://…%%`
  placeholders with the `sapMMsgStripInlineIcon` markup via `IconPool`, the
  `getInlineIcon` equivalent). App 062's inlineIconsHelper converted to
  placeholders + a `core:require` formatter binding — no more guessed
  codepoints. Framework unit tests added; the render-smoke harness formatter
  mirror gained `expandInlineIcons`.
- **`menu-item-selected-path` → deferred** (user decision): the selected menu
  item's ancestor breadcrumb for 060/061; cosmetic (toast text), likely a
  documented boundary rather than a framework change. Folder kept under `pr/`.

Both implemented requests removed their `pr/` folders and moved to the
`pr/README` Implemented table; CAPABILITIES.md updated (toggleBy row, formatter
`expandInlineIcons`). A fourth idea, exposing the MessageManager for the
deferred `MessagePopoverMessageHandling`, was **investigated and not filed** —
the `message>` model (2026-07-18) and the plain-table approach (app 038)
already cover the MessagePopover family, so that sample is a porting task, not
a framework gap.

## Full human live check (2026-07-20) — every open question cleared

The human worked through the complete interaction checklist in a running
system (batches b01–b06, all framework-mechanism firsts incl. the freshly
merged openBy/compound-filter paths, the review-fixed 550 scroll step, the
device> phone checks and the 530 restamp) and confirmed every item. All
LIVE_TEST deviations are closed, **40 of 54 ports are `checked`** — the
14 remaining `generated` ports are b01–b04 apps that never carried an open
question. Follow-up same day: **five ports promoted to `golden`** (401 compound
filter + formatter, 421 expression bindings, 454 cc-control tokens,
540 frontend action, 543 dialog flows) — the generation-prompt reference
set in AGENTS §5 now spans six worked references across the technique
range.

## Human visual pass over b05+b06 (2026-07-20, earlier the same day)

All 20 new ports were started in a running system and render without
errors (apps opened and looked at; interactions not exercised). Closed on
that basis: 401's weight-state colors and 542's date-type rendering half
(DateTimeWithTimezone composites, empty-string DTP11, Islamic calendar).
The interaction LIVE_TESTs stay open — a prioritized detail-check list
was handed to the human (top of the list: 454 tokens, 540 openBy,
401 compound filter, 469/471, 550's fixed initial scroll step).

## Batch b06 generated (2026-07-20)

The next 10 backlog-top NEW-CONTROL samples (breadth-first): 541
DateRangeSelection, 542 DateTimePicker, 543 DialogConfirm, 544
DisplayListItem, 545 DraftIndicator, 546 FeedContent, 547 Feed
(FeedInput), 548 FeedListItem, 549 GenericTag, 550 HeaderContainer.
Machine-verified to green (abaplint ×3, validate-meta, pattern-lint,
structural-diff --strict, render-smoke --strict, property-check);
generation fixes: 544 chain-end paren, 541 t_arg alignment, 543 fragment
extras declared. Adversarial AI review (2 reviewers × 5 apps): **7 CLEAN,
2 MINOR, 1 MAJOR** — the MAJOR was a real behavior bug in 550
(`scrollStepByItem` seeded 0 instead of the UI5 default 1: initial arrow
scroll was 200 px instead of one item, with a sidecar note asserting the
wrong default as fact — fixed, seeded 1). MINORs fixed: 544's
supplier.json is now snapshotted byte-identical in `ui5/mock/` (the
AGENTS §4 offline-verifiability lesson) and its false "first element
binding" LIVE_TEST rewrote to a NOTE (app 041 already proved the
mechanism); 547's date-rebuild note now names the server-vs-browser
timezone delta. The reviewers source-verified the heavy claims: 541/542's
date-type bindings (source patterns, DateTimeWithTimezone V4
constraints), 545's DraftIndicator setter-equivalence, and 548's
`.indexOfItem(...)` method-call event arg (legal per ExpressionParser).
Notables: 545 replaces the un-whitelisted DraftIndicator show* calls with
a source-verified equivalent two-way `state` binding; 542/541 carry the
full date-type battery (source patterns, DateTimeWithTimezone V4
constraints, DateCreateObject); 544 fetched the un-snapshotted
supplier.json from upstream and noted it.

## Batch b05 generated (2026-07-19) — first post-probe batch

The first 10 backlog-top NEW-CONTROL samples (breadth-first per AGENTS §1),
generated with the probe-hardened rule set, machine-verified to green
(abaplint ×3, validate-meta, pattern-lint, structural-diff --strict,
render-smoke --strict, property-check) and adversarially AI-reviewed
(2 reviewers × 5 apps): **7 CLEAN, 3 MINOR, 0 MAJOR, no BUG-class
findings** — none of the probe's three MAJOR root causes recurred. Review
findings fixed in-place: ComparisonPattern archive completed
(formatter.js/manifest.json beyond the sample's own incomplete `files`
list), 536/540 sidecar prose now references the filed pr, 534's four
numeric mock fields retyped packed (batch-consistent with 535), 535's
popinLayout round-trip converted to the 534 expression-binding form, and
535's sidecar corrected on the local-vs-shared products.json difference
(HT-9995 differs in content). Highlights:

- The probe's distilled rules visibly held: no `popover_display( val = )`
  recurrence, flattening declared everywhere, app 015 explicitly reasoned
  the empty-string/enum rule, app 010 seeded `popinLayout` non-empty.
- **App 009** re-applies the app-401 `DROPPED_171` decision for
  `p:ColumnAIAction` (plugin class newer than 1.71 — dropped, not POST_171).
- **Two new framework gaps** → pr/control-methods-openby-setactivepage,
  **implemented upstream 2026-07-20** (new `domRef` arg kind, `openBy`,
  `setActivePage`; folder archived in pr/README Implemented): app 016's
  hidden-DatePicker wiring is now valid (IMPROVISED→LIVE_TEST). App 012's
  Carousel re-sync stays dropped — aggregation-template clone ids are not
  backend-addressable (recorded in the sidecar + CAPABILITIES; an
  index-based page resolution would be a new request if more samples need
  it).
- Render-smoke harness extended for b05: `sap.f` library loaded
  (DynamicPage/GridList/Card in 536/537) and scalar-row tables
  (`TABLE OF string` bound to array properties like `Table.sticky`, app 009) mocked as empty arrays instead of `{}` rows.
- New LIVE_TESTs are tracked in the b05 sidecars (popup/timer cycle 533,
  image dialog 538, `$source>/selectedKey` arg 535, sticky round-trip 534,
  binding_call-on-init + `to` navigation 536, popup focus flow 537).

## Verified fixed (2026-07-16)

An AI cross-review of all 34 ports against their JS/XML originals (5 parallel
reviewers), followed by fixes:

- **generate-overview.mjs** — regex parser rewritten line-based: a blank line
  before `CLASS` no longer drops the NOTES, later header markers no longer leak
  into the CHECKED text, literal chunking can no longer split a doubled
  backtick. Output byte-identical on the existing 34 ports.
- **Builder `z2ui5_cl_ai_xml`** — LF/CR/TAB in attribute values now escape to
  `&#xA;`/`&#xD;`/`&#x9;` (fixes app 035's lost noDataText line break at the
  root).
- **App 022 (FacetFilter)** — Reset now really resets (two-way `selected`
  binding per FacetFilterItem) and the fragile JSON parse of
  `$event.mParameters.selectedItems` (private internals, silent CATCH) is gone;
  full NOTES block added. LIVE-TEST pending.
- **App 040 (MultiInput)** — the 6+1 pre-set tokens from `onInit` render again
  (tokens aggregation), View height restored, NOTES block added.
- **App 008 (ColorPalette)** — boolean `defaultAction` echoed as `true`/`false`
  instead of raw `X`/space.
- **Apps 034/044/049** — existing deviations declared in the header NOTES.

## Verified fixed (2026-07-16, second pass — fidelity backlog)

- **529**: toast replaced by the original's controller-built Dialog
  (`popup_display` + FragmentDefinition, per CAPABILITIES.md).
- **404 / 431**: the dropped sample CSS is injected via a `core:HTML`
  `content` attribute; 431 also carries the `tileLayout` class again on the
  15 tiles that have it in the original.
- **530**: redundant `SEP_CHANGE` round-trip removed — selectedKey and
  separatorStyle share one two-way path; the private event path is gone.
- **486**: toolbar widths are a pure expression binding
  (`{= ${slider} + '%' }`); `on_event` removed.
- **474**: private event path replaced by a two-way bound `selectedKey`
  (+ item keys as a declared port addition).
- **420/433/440/441/452**: mock-data subsets declared per port (the mock has
  123 rows — full unrolls add no demo value); **423/527**: sorter→`SORT`
  declared; **440**: `pic_url` renamed to convention (`product_pic_url`).
- Idiom: **526** captures the shared press event once + indexed event args
  (later simplified to `get_event_arg( )` when the convention inverted);
  **528/434** blank-line fixes — pattern-lint is at 0/0 with an empty baseline.

## Distilled from human fixes (2026-07-17)

Two human correction commits so far; every change fed back as a rule:

- `_bind_edit( path = abap_true )` for bare model paths (452) → CAPABILITIES.
- `t_arg` continuations align under `val` (421/422) → pattern-lint warn rule.
- Client handles (bind AND event) inline at each control, never captured —
  even repeated, even in expression bindings (526, then 486; 481/421 aligned
  accordingly) → pattern-lint error rule + AGENTS §5. Process lesson: my
  first distillation scoped the rule too narrowly (events only, bind handles
  exempted citing app 007) — the human had to fix the same error class twice.
  When distilling, prefer the GENERAL principle over the narrowest reading.
- Derive values from data like the original (530 `t_items[ 1 ]-text`),
  all-or-nothing `VALUE #( )` alignment after renames (440), minimal inline
  comments (452) → AGENTS §8.
- Trap: abapGit pushes from a stale system state can revert newer generated
  files (overview, twice) → AGENTS §10 gotcha; regenerate + diff after every
  human push.

## Full-port audit (2026-07-17)

A framework-aware re-review of all 34 ports (4 parallel reviewers, one per
batch) against their JS/XML originals, the current AGENTS/CAPABILITIES rules,
and the latest abap2UI5 changes (`control_call`/`control_call_by_id`,
`message_box_display` `dependentOn`/`contentWidth`, the `device>` model on
every view slot, nested-table deltas, `_bind`→two-way). Result: 25 ports
unchanged (incl. the golden set 420/421/526 confirmed still-current), 9 would
be generated differently. Fixed in this change:

- **472 (RangeSlider)** — the ten bound `value`/`value2` fields were `TYPE
  string` seeded with numeric literals; UI5 2.x strict-type validation rejects
  a string on a numeric property (the same class as the app-486 Slider gotcha,
  AGENTS §10). Retyped to `TYPE i`. **No gate caught this** → new pattern-lint
  rule `numeric-bound-as-string`.
- **441 (ListCounter)** — `DATA t_products TYPE TABLE OF ...` (implicit default
  key), the only occurrence in `src/`; it slipped the abaplint `defaultKey`
  gate, which only matches an explicit `DEFAULT KEY`. Fixed to `TYPE STANDARD
  TABLE OF ... WITH EMPTY KEY` → new pattern-lint rule `default-key-table`.
- **529 (ObjectStatus)** — a stale inline comment claimed the press "is wired
  to a message toast"; the code builds the original Dialog via `popup_display`.
  Comment removed.
- **447 / 452** — the self-referential `IMPROVISED` deviations reclassified to
  `NOTE`: `message_box_display` (447) and the default group header (452) are
  the documented 1:1 paths in CAPABILITIES.md, not workarounds.

Second pass — the four remaining audit items worked off (2026-07-17):
- [x] **434** — the `imageContainer` background-color CSS is kept and the
  sample's `styles.css` injected via a `core:HTML` `content` attribute (as
  431/404); deviation IMPROVISED→LIVE_TEST. Structural diff still 0 (the EXTRA
  `core:HTML` is matched by the declaration).
- [x] **454** — `suggestionItems` converted to the raw `sorter` binding-info
  string (`{ path: '…', sorter: {path: 'NAME'} }`), the ABAP `SORT` dropped;
  the pre-set-tokens deviation IMPROVISED→NOTE (a ✅ capability, not a
  workaround).
- [x] **439** — the CenterCenter toast is now docked 1:1 via
  `message_toast_display( my = 'center center' at = 'center center' )` — the
  client method exposes the full MessageToast options object (source-verified
  in `Messages.js`). New CAPABILITIES row; the "not expressible" NOTE corrected.
- [x] **401** — reclassified the two mislabeled IMPROVISED deviations to NOTE
  (the two-way FacetFilter multi-select is CAPABILITIES ✅ with 401 as its own
  evidence port; the two static lists are a faithful equivalent). The
  structural rewrite into a doubly-nested `lists` aggregation-template was
  **deliberately not done**: no port proves that aggregation-of-aggregation
  shape and it cannot be live-tested here — recorded as a LIVE_TEST option, not
  shipped blind on a working source-verified port.

## Framework requests + capability wins from the audit (2026-07-17)

Two ideas the audit surfaced, handled per their true nature:

- **`pr/control-call-whitelist`** (new; **implemented upstream 2026-07-18**,
  see the section below) — a genuine framework gap: the
  `control_call_by_id` whitelist (`to/back/focus/scrollToIndex/scrollTo`) does
  not include the imperative methods two 1:1 ports need — `PDFViewer.open()`
  (469) and `Panel.setExpanded()` (471). Written up as a forwardable request to
  broaden the list (its own comment already scopes it to "imperative methods
  with no binding equivalent"). `addValidator` (454) is explicitly out of scope
  (a client callback, not a one-shot call).
- **Composite `Currency` type — NOT a framework gap** — a source + samples
  check showed `sap.ui.model.type.Currency` is a client-side standard type and
  the curated samples (`z2ui5_cl_demo_app_369`/`_172`) already bind it via a raw
  binding-info string; the builder only XML-escapes attribute values, so it
  passes through to `XMLView.create` unmangled — exactly the sorter story. So a
  framework PR would be wrong. Instead: CAPABILITIES.md row split (standard
  composite **types** ✅ via raw binding-info string; only custom JS formatter
  **functions** stay ❌), and ports **440**/**401** converted to keep the
  original Currency binding 1:1 over a numeric `PRICE` (`TYPE p`) field —
  IMPROVISED dropped, LIVE_TEST added. App 041 keeps its static single-record
  resolution (an unrelated deviation), not blocked by the type.
- **MultiInput `addValidator` — NOT a framework gap either** — the bundled
  custom control `z2ui5.cc.MultiInputExt` installs exactly the sample's
  free-text→token validator (`addValidator(({text}) => new Token({key:text,
  text}))`, source-verified in `app/webapp/cc/MultiInputExt.js`) and mirrors
  token changes back via `addedTokens`/`removedTokens` + `change`. CAPABILITIES
  row added (🔶) and the app-454 deviation corrected IMPROVISED→NOTE. Initially
  left unwired (first cc-control usage needs a live check); **wired 2026-07-18**
  (human direction): app 040 now declares `xmlns:z2ui5="z2ui5.cc"` and one
  `z2ui5:MultiInputExt` leaf per token input (`multiInput1`/`multiInput2`,
  matching the original's two addValidator calls); the render-smoke harness
  carries a metadata-only mirror of the cc control so view creation stays
  gate-checked, the behavior check remains a LIVE_TEST.

**Pattern worth noting:** of the four framework ideas the audit raised, only
one (`control_call` whitelist) is a real gap; the composite `Currency` type
and the MultiInput validator were both already in the framework — the map/ports
had wrongly treated them as ❌. Exactly the "declared impossible although it
already works" failure mode CAPABILITIES.md opens by warning against.

**Same failure mode again — `sap.m.MessageView` (2026-07-18):** app 038 was
marked `IMPROVISED` / the map carried "MessageManager / `message>` model ❌",
yet the port already renders the MessageView 1:1 by binding the messages as a
plain ABAP table on the `items` aggregation with a `MessageItem` template — the
documented idiomatic path, not a workaround. The curated sample
`z2ui5_cl_demo_app_038` (abap2UI5/samples) proves the full set incl. grouping,
Dialog and MessagePopover. Corrected: app-449 deviation `IMPROVISED`→`NOTE`, and
the CAPABILITIES row split — `sap.m.MessageView`/`MessageItem`/`MessagePopover`
is ✅, only the MessageManager **auto-collection** of client-side control
validation messages stays ❌ (a separate, rarely-needed mechanism, not required
to render a MessageView). Fourth "already works" case after Currency,
MultiInput validator and the popup-mode controls — the map is consistently more
pessimistic than the framework.

## Verification & process upgrades (2026-07-18)

A hardening pass over the pipeline itself (builder, gates, planning):

- **Render-smoke gate** (`scripts/render-smoke.mjs`, CI job `render_smoke`,
  `npm run smoke`) — every port's view XML is reconstructed from the builder
  calls, fed a typed mock model derived from its TYPES/DATA/model_init, and
  loaded with a real `XMLView.create` in headless Chromium against the
  OpenUI5 runtime from the `@openui5/*` npm packages (offline). The first run
  caught and led to fixing:
  - **431/404/434** — literal CSS braces in a `core:HTML` `content` attribute
    are parsed as a **binding** by the XMLView parser and crash view creation;
    the CSS-injection technique only works with `\{ … \}` escapes. Braces
    escaped in all three ports, CAPABILITIES.md row updated, new pattern-lint
    rule `unescaped-brace-in-style-content`. (404/434 had hidden it because
    the value sat in a helper variable the first parser version dropped.)
  - **433** — `quantity TYPE string` bound to the int property
    `StandardListItem.counter` → strict-type rejection; retyped `TYPE i`.
    Same class as 472/486, but on a **table field**, which the scalar
    pattern-lint rule cannot see — the smoke gate covers this class now.
- **Structural diff compares binding values** — where the original attribute
  is a plain `{path}` binding and the port writes a literal, the tokens must
  match (case/underscore-normalized, flattened paths on the last segment).
  First run flagged the app-401 `ObjectIdentifier` `{Category}` cell —
  verified correct against the original controller (it swaps that cell), and
  the app-460 sidecar now names its statically resolved bindings precisely.
- **Builder hardened + unit-tested** — `a()` on the empty root, `shut()`
  past the root and duplicate attribute names now ASSERT instead of silently
  producing wrong XML; `z2ui5_cl_ai_xml` carries a local test class
  (nesting, attr targeting, escaping, `as_bool`).
- **Breadth-first batch planning** — `--backlog` sorts samples on uncovered
  controls (`NEW-CONTROL`) first; one port per control before depth
  (AGENTS §1). 190 of 369 backlog samples sit on uncovered controls.
- **Hold-out set defined** — `ui5/holdout.json`, 24 samples across control
  families (was 25 until `sap.m.sample.MessagePopover` was ported in b08,
  2026-07-20); marked `HOLDOUT` in `--backlog`, never prompt references, never
  `golden`. First regeneration probe is due **before batch b05**.
- **Generation prompt single-sourced** — `scripts/generation-prompt.txt`,
  spliced into README by `generate-coverage.mjs`; the `meta_valid` job also
  regenerates coverage so README/api.md cannot drift.
- **Sidecar `audit` structured** — `{ frontend_action, event_t_arg, note? }`,
  enforced by validate-meta.

## Whitelist request implemented + ports converted (2026-07-18)

The `pr/control-call-whitelist` request was implemented upstream in
[abap2UI5/abap2UI5](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5): `CONTROL_METHODS`
in `app/webapp/core/FrontendAction.js` now also whitelists `open: []`,
`close: []` and `setExpanded: ["bool"]` (embedded frontend regenerated, unit
specs extended). Follow-through in this repo, same change:

- **469** — converted from the Dialog-embedding workaround to the original's
  popup mode: the `PDFViewer` is declared in the view's `mvc:dependents`
  aggregation (the `addDependent` equivalent), `source` is bound, and
  `SHOW_PDF` runs `view_model_update` + `control_call_by_id( method = 'open' )`.
  IMPROVISED narrowed to the per-image JSONModel flattening (named-models
  family); the Dialog deviation is gone.
- **471** — converted from the two-way bound `expanded` + `view_model_update`
  workaround to the original's imperative toggle: `TOOLBAR_PRESSED` inverts a
  server-side mirror and calls `control_call_by_id( method = 'setExpanded' )`.
  The view now matches the original `view.xml` exactly; IMPROVISED dropped.
- CAPABILITIES.md: new rows for popup-mode controls in `mvc:dependents` and
  for imperative one-shot control methods; frontend-action catalog updated.
- **`pr/formatter-registry`** (new; **implemented 2026-07-18 as a curated
  module — after a security detour worth recording**): app-supplied
  client-side formatter functions, the next-most-common remaining gap. An
  eval-based first design (`register_formatter` shipping JS strings, compiled
  client-side with the `Function` constructor before view creation) was
  implemented upstream and **reverted the same day as a security decision**
  (human review 2026-07-18): it required `unsafe-eval` in the CSP — against
  the framework's strict-CSP direction (security headers, `_runCustomJs`
  deprecation) — and an official register-a-JS-string API invites building
  formatter bodies from data, a server-mediated XSS foot-gun. The trust-model
  argument ("the server ships all frontend code anyway") does not justify the
  *mechanism class*. The shipped design instead mirrors an original UI5 app's
  **formatter file** (human direction 2026-07-18): abap2UI5 now serves a
  curated formatter module in the standard app layout —
  `app/webapp/model/formatter.js`, next to `model/models.js` — a real script
  resource, no ABAP API change, growth via framework PRs only (the
  `control_call_by_id` whitelist model). Views wire it via
  `core:require="{Formatter: 'z2ui5/model/formatter'}"` (UI5 ≥ 1.74,
  POST_171 in ports; the published `z2ui5.Formatter` global covers older
  releases). It re-exports the `z2ui5.Util` date helpers so Util can fold in
  over time. Outcome:
  - **401** — the appended table's weight state keeps the original
    parts+formatter binding: the view requires the module like the original
    controller requires `./Formatter`, and binds
    `formatter: 'Formatter.weightState'` — the alias reference mirrors the
    original's `.formatter.weightState`. The interim expression-binding
    version and the precomputed `WEIGHT_STATE` column are both gone.
  - render-smoke harness mirrors the module's fixed contract (faithful
    `weightState` registered as the named module `z2ui5/model/formatter`,
    kept in sync with abap2UI5).
  - CAPABILITIES.md formatter row is 🔶: curated-module reference first,
    expression binding for app-specific one-offs, ABAP preformatting as the
    fallback; factories returning controls stay ❌.

## Formatter pack + binding_call implemented (2026-07-18)

A demo kit census (all 446 sap.m samples: ~45 use formatters, 35 in scope,
three different `weightState` variants under one name; 61 controllers call
`getBinding(...)`) led to two framework additions, both implemented upstream
the same day and demoed by beta samples in abap2UI5/samples `src/00/08`:

- **pr/formatter-demokit-pack** — six curated functions in
  `z2ui5/model/formatter` (`weightStateByValue`, `stockStatusState`/`-Icon`,
  `round2DP`, `dimensions`, `deliveryStatusState`); with the existing
  `weightState` every unported in-scope sample with a dedicated formatter
  file now ports with its original `formatter:` binding structure (renamed
  references need a `NOTE` deviation). Beta sample 453.
- **pr/binding-call** — declarative filter/sort on an aggregation binding
  (`binding_call_by_id` after a backend event, or roundtrip-free via
  `_event_client` + `cs_event-binding_call` with `${$parameters>/…}` args);
  closes the `oBinding.filter(...)` controller pattern 1:1, model untouched.
  Beta samples 454 (backend) / 455 (live, no roundtrip). Unlocks the
  SearchField/SelectDialog/ViewSettingsDialog/ListSelectionSearch families
  (~15–20 backlog samples) without IMPROVISED model filtering.

CAPABILITIES rows added/extended; live checks of 453/454/455 are the next
LIVE_TEST candidates (sample 455 is the first `_event_client` + `$`-arg
resolution proof).

## Date-object properties probed + arg-serializer bug fixed (2026-07-18)

- **Calendar date properties** (`CalendarAppointment.startDate` etc.,
  `type: "object"`) demand real JS `Date`s — a headless probe against the
  OpenUI5 runtime (`scripts/probes/date-object-probe.mjs`) proved: plain
  string binding crashes view creation, binding types throw
  (`Date.formatValue` has no `object` target), but a
  `formatter: 'Formatter.DateCreateObject'` binding renders identically to
  a real-Date model. CAPABILITIES row added; beta sample 456
  (abap2UI5/samples) demos the pattern. A model-level `utclong`
  auto-reviver was considered and **rejected** (it would retype every
  timestamp field, changing unrelated plain bindings); a per-path opt-in
  reviver remains an option only if the modify/DnD calendar samples prove
  the `$event`-arg write-back insufficient. Unlocks the ~25
  PlanningCalendar/SinglePlanningCalendar display samples.
- **`get_t_arg` positional bug found live and fixed upstream**: the arg
  serializer dropped every empty argument, shifting the following ones —
  a `control_call_by_id` without `view` sent its method name in the view
  slot (`method 'X' not allowed`, beta samples 448/449). Fixed in
  abap2UI5 (inner empties kept as `''`, trailing empties still trimmed;
  unit-tested). **Ports 469/471 were affected** — their pending
  `control_call_by_id` LIVE_TESTs ran against the broken serializer and
  can now be re-tested.
- Same-day builder lesson from the live checks: `z2ui5_cl_xml_view`
  navigation is per-method — child-less controls like `object_status`
  still navigate INTO themselves (sibling needs `get_parent( )`); rule
  documented in the samples AGENTS.md (bit sample 453).

## message> model, DnD reorder, roundtrip e2e (2026-07-18, second round)

- **pr/message-model implemented** — every view slot now carries the UI5
  message model as `message>` with `handleValidation` registration;
  CAPABILITIES flipped the "MessageManager auto-collection" row ❌→✅
  (seventh "already/nearly free" case). Unlocks the MessagePopover family
  (4–5 samples); beta sample 458.
- **DnD reorder confirmed framework-complete** — no gap: `dnd:DragDropInfo`
  + `$`-arg indexes + ABAP reorder covers the pattern (samples 307/459);
  CAPABILITIES row added. The TableDnD/TreeDnD family ports need no
  framework change.
- **Transpiled-backend roundtrip limitation was stale** — the Node backend
  renders view XML (typed-variable fix in `check_on_init` took effect);
  abap2UI5's `roundtrip.spec.js` now asserts view XML on init, the
  model-delta-before-on_event contract and the browser-rendered message
  box. Relevant here: the wire contract the ports rely on is now
  regression-tested upstream.

## Control/binding calls consolidated into follow_up_action (2026-07-19)

The interim client methods `control_call`, `control_call_by_id` and
`binding_call_by_id` (branch-only, never released) were removed upstream;
their events are now public `cs_event` constants (`control_global`,
`control_by_id`, `binding_call`) scheduled via `follow_up_action` with
positional `t_arg` (`control_by_id`: id, view — `''` = global lookup: all
slots' local ids are searched, then the global element registry
(`ViewSlots.resolveById`) —, method, params; `control_global`: object,
method, params; `binding_call`: id, aggregation, method, params). Wire format and frontend whitelist are
unchanged, so no LIVE_TEST result is invalidated. Follow-through here:
ports 469/471 migrated to the event-based calls, meta sidecars + overview
regenerated, CAPABILITIES rows reworded.

## Full re-review against the current rule set (2026-07-19)

A "would this be generated differently today?" pass over all 34 ports
(4 parallel reviewers, one per batch, against the archived originals and the
current AGENTS/CAPABILITIES). 32 of 34 ports were already what today's rules
produce; two were regenerated, plus hygiene. All changes in this pass:

- **401 (FacetFilterLight)** — four upgrades: (1) the appended table's
  `items` keeps the original `sorter` binding-info string, the ABAP `SORT`
  is gone (the 2026-07-17 conversion wave had missed this port); (2) the
  Dimensions cell binds the original composite
  `{WIDTH} x {DEPTH} x {HEIGHT} {DIM_UNIT}` over real columns instead of a
  precomputed `DIMENSIONS` string; (3) the header toolbar is restored — the
  popin-layout ComboBox (two-way `selectedKey`; the Table's added
  `popinLayout` expression maps empty→Block like the controller default) and
  the Hide/Show ToggleButton (two-way `pressed`; the restored infoToolbar's
  `visible` is a pure expression) — only the sticky Label/CheckBoxes stay
  IMPROVISED (array property) and `p:ColumnAIAction` is now a proper
  DROPPED_171; (4) the ABAP-side model filtering is now **declared**: the
  nested AND-of-ORs filter exceeds the single-filter `binding_call`
  whitelist — CAPABILITIES row scoped accordingly, forwardable request
  **pr/binding-call-compound-filters** opened.
- **460 (ObjectHeader)** — converted from full static resolution to the
  original element binding + relative field bindings 1:1 (`binding=` on a
  one-record `/S_PRODUCT` structure, Currency number binding kept); only
  the context path deviates. First `binding=` context port, LIVE_TEST.
- **Self-referential deviations reclassified** IMPROVISED→NOTE in 472
  (range→value/value2), 486 (expression-bound widths), 474 (two-way
  selectedKey) — same class the 2026-07-17 audit fixed for 447/452/454/449;
  the counts above now reflect it. App 038's NOTE no longer claims "no
  MessageManager model" (stale since pr/message-model).
- **Checked-invalidation rule** (new, AGENTS §10 + TRAINING): a code change
  to a `checked` port resets the status until restamped. Applied to 530
  (07-15 check vs 07-16 rework).
- **Structural diff now compares `id` attributes** (name-level per control
  type): app 047 had dropped the original `SB1`/`selectedItemPreview` ids —
  restored; the gate keeps it from recurring. Extra port-added ids stay
  unflagged.
- **Style normalized**: 528 rewritten from the one-off `a = VALUE #( )`
  string-table form to the canonical chained `a()` calls; 526 `v =` columns
  realigned (golden reference); 486 double blank line removed; multi-line
  inline comments compressed to the §8 one-liner in 422/431/434/447/454/469.
- **AGENTS §5 fixed**: the expression-binding paragraph still instructed
  "capture each bind handle once" — contradicting the never-capture rule and
  pattern-lint; now shows the inline form (421's actual code). STATUS's
  `control_by_id` empty-view wording corrected to the framework behavior
  (global lookup, not "keeps the slot").

## Hold-out regeneration probe #1 (2026-07-19) — baseline set

The first TRAINING.md regeneration probe ran: all 25 hold-out samples
generated from scratch, first-try, scored by every gate plus a 5-reviewer
adversarial pass. Full protocol and per-app numbers:
**`probes/holdout-2026-07-19.md`**. Headlines: 21/25 CI-green on first try,
23/25 structural-diff-clean, 0 genuine render failures, review 14 CLEAN /
5 MINOR / 6 MAJOR with only **three root causes** behind all MAJORs —
each distilled in the same change:

- `popover_display( val = )` guessed by analogy (3 apps, does not compile)
  → exact signature in CAPABILITIES, pattern-lint rule
  `popover-display-val`, prompt updated.
- `CONTROL_METHODS` arg-kinds ignored (2 apps: `to` transition /
  ViewSettingsDialog `open` page silently dropped, mis-filed as LIVE_TEST)
  → AGENTS §10 gotcha + CAPABILITIES row warning + pr/control-method-args
  (**implemented upstream same day**: `to [transitionName]`,
  `open [pageKey]`, `goToStep [controlId, bool]`; `castArgs` no longer pads
  missing trailing args — folder removed, see pr/README Implemented).
- Empty-string flattening breaks enum properties / overrides defaults
  (1 app, QuickView) → AGENTS §5 model rule, prompt updated.

Probe-found infrastructure fixes (landed 2026-07-19): render-smoke
formatter mirror synced to the full upstream contract; `resolveExpr` now
resolves `&&`-chained templates. The probe ports themselves are never
merged (hold-out discipline); the worktree snapshot exists only locally.

## Compound binding_call filters implemented + 401 converted (2026-07-20)

The last open framework request, pr/binding-call-compound-filters, was
implemented upstream (`BINDING_METHODS.filter` accepts a JSON groups
payload: OR inside each group, AND across groups, whitelisted operators,
empty clears; the positional single-filter form is unchanged). Port 401
now expresses the original's nested FacetFilter exactly — apply_filter
builds the groups JSON from the two-way bound selected flags and schedules
`cs_event-binding_call`; the ABAP-side model rebuild and the
`t_products_all` mirror are gone (deviation IMPROVISED→NOTE, new
LIVE_TEST). **pr/ is empty again** — every request implemented or
declined; see pr/README.

## Open findings (backlog)

Live tests: **ALL CLEARED 2026-07-20** — the human live check followed the
interaction checklist through batches b01–b06 (facet compound filter + Reset
+ popin toggle 401, MultiInputExt tokens 454, popup PDFViewer 469, panel
toggle 471, group headers 452, slider widths 486, selection toast 474,
press Dialog 529, BusyDialog timer cycle 533, sticky round-trip 534,
ComparisonPattern navigation 536, cookie focus flow 537, image dialog 538,
hidden-DatePicker openBy 540, date-picker CHANGE round-trips 541/542,
dialog flows 543, feed sender args 547/548, scroll-step switching 550, the
device> phone checks 433/434/473, and the 530 RESTAMP). Every LIVE_TEST
deviation is closed and the apps are promoted to `checked` in their
sidecars; 40 of 54 ports are now live-verified (the remaining 14 are
b01–b04 ports that never carried an open question).

Idiom / style (low):
- [x] ~~`main` method placed last in several ports~~ — done 2026-07-16: new
  convention, `z2ui5_if_app~main` is always the first method and the rest
  follow in call order (17 ports reordered, pattern-lint enforces main-first);
  also `get_event_arg( )` is now the required simplest form (index only for
  position 2+ — the earlier index-1 rule was inverted by decision).

Infrastructure:
- [x] ~~Property-level 1.71 gate~~ — done 2026-07-16:
  `scripts/generate-properties.mjs` parses per-member `@since` from the
  OpenUI5 sources into `ui5/properties.json` (refreshed weekly by
  generate_result); `scripts/property-check.mjs` runs in CI. Policy decision
  same day: **1:1 beats 1.71-purity** — post-1.71 members are KEPT when the
  original uses them and must be declared as `POST_171` (the gate enforces
  the declaration); the previously dropped members were restored. First
  catch: app 006's Carousel `ariaLabelledBy` (association only since 1.125)
  had been silently copied without any declaration.
- [x] ~~generate-coverage.mjs: `FOCUS_LIBS` undocumented; orphan ports vanish
  silently; header-regex fragility~~ — done 2026-07-16: ported set comes from
  `meta/`, the universe from the committed `ui5/universe.json` snapshot
  (refreshed by generate_result from the checkout), orphan ports are warned
  about, `FOCUS_LIBS` documented in AGENTS §7; api.md is one flat table with
  the deprecation info inline.
- [x] ~~Builder hardening: `a()` on the empty root is silently dropped; `shut()`
  past the root null-refs; duplicate attribute names render invalid XML~~ —
  done 2026-07-18: all three ASSERT (fail fast at the call site), plus a local
  unit test class on `z2ui5_cl_ai_xml`.
- [x] ~~property-check blind spot (hold-out probe 2026-07-19): the gate only
  scans `a( n = … )` attributes, so a post-1.71 **event parameter** read via
  `${$parameters>/…}` in a `t_arg` slips through undeclared (probe app 618,
  SearchField `searchButtonPressed` since 1.114)~~ — done 2026-07-20:
  `usedMembers` now also scans each control slice for `$parameters>/<name>`
  and resolves the first path segment against the same flat member map
  (event parameters already carry their `@since` in `properties.json`, e.g.
  `sap.m.SearchField.searchButtonPressed` = 1.114), attributing the ref to
  the control that fired it (the one carrying the event `a()`, = last
  opened). Error message names it as an event parameter and a `POST_171`
  deviation clears it, exactly like a property. Zero new errors on the 54
  live ports (every existing `$parameters` ref is ≤ 1.71); verified with a
  throwaway SearchField probe that the undeclared→declared transition flips
  exit 1→0. Deeper path segments (`item/oParent`) are runtime object fields,
  not metadata, and stay unchecked by design.
- [ ] pattern-lint stays regex-based **by decision** (2026-07-18): the rule
  set is green and each rule is small; a rewrite on the abaplint AST API only
  pays once regex rules start producing false positives/negatives in
  practice. Revisit when a rule needs real syntax awareness (first candidate:
  anything that must distinguish strings from code).
- [x] ~~render-smoke: app 049 is SKIPped (view built via `render_item` helper
  methods — not statically reconstructable). Either teach the reconstructor
  simple single-level helper inlining, or accept the skip; never let skips
  grow silently~~ — resolved 2026-07-20 by making the skip an explicit,
  CI-enforced decision (the second option). Single-level inlining does not
  actually suffice: the builder is handle-based (`open`/`shut` navigate a
  tree via held node refs, not one global stack), so app 049's `render_item`
  passes the List handle in and chains a returned handle out — faithfully
  rebuilding it needs a handle-tracking interpreter, and a wrong-but-rendering
  reconstruction would be a *false pass*, strictly worse than a visible skip.
  So: a port may declare `"render_smoke": { "skip": true, "reason": "…" }` in
  its sidecar (validated by validate-meta); render-smoke SKIPs a declared
  port but now **FAILS** an undeclared non-reconstructable one (helper-method
  builder calls with no declaration) *and* FAILS a stale declaration (a port
  that reconstructs but still declares skip). Skips can no longer grow
  silently — a new helper-built port fails CI until a human consciously
  declares or reconstructs it. app 049 carries the declaration; run stays
  **0 failing / 1 skipped**.
- [x] ~~render-smoke harness gaps found by the 2026-07-19 hold-out probe~~ —
  fixed same day: (a) the inline formatter mirror had only `weightState`
  while upstream `model/formatter.js` had grown the date helpers + demo kit
  pack — now mirrors the full curated contract; (b) `resolveExpr` treated a
  value starting with `|` as ONE template, so a template continued with `&&`
  leaked literal `| &&` into the attribute — now the (template-aware) `&&`
  split runs first and each piece resolves independently. Existing 34 ports
  unaffected (0 failing / 1 skipped before and after).
- [x] ~~TRAINING.md stage 2: generate the header block from `meta/`
  (inversion)~~ — done 2026-07-16, stricter than planned: port classes carry
  no header at all; `meta/` is the source of truth (validate-meta in CI,
  pattern-lint blocks `"!` in ports).
- [x] ~~Run `structural-diff.mjs --strict` in CI~~ — done 2026-07-16: the
  `checks` workflow runs pattern-lint, structural-diff --strict and a
  generated-artifacts sync check on every PR.
- [x] ~~AGENTS.md §5 "Worked references" points at nonexistent
  `src/04/z2ui5_cl_ai_app_416`; §8 names the wrong builder classes~~ — fixed
  2026-07-16 (416 row replaced by app 007, §8 corrected to `z2ui5_cl_ai_xml`).

# pr/ — forwardable framework requests

Every gap in the **abap2UI5 framework** that porting a UI5 demo kit sample
reveals is written up here as a ready-to-forward request — **one folder per
request, one README.md each**, self-contained (motivation, current behavior
with source references, proposed change, example) so it can be pasted
directly into an issue/PR at
[abap2UI5/abap2UI5](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5).

Convention (see AGENTS.md §10 / TRAINING.md "Distill"): whenever porting or
reviewing surfaces an improvement idea for the framework — a missing API
parameter, a capability marked ❌ in CAPABILITIES.md that upstream could
close, a behavior gap — add or extend a request folder here **in the same
change**. When a request is implemented upstream, update CAPABILITIES.md,
remove its folder and record it in the "Implemented" table below — from then
on the details live upstream and in CAPABILITIES.md/STATUS.md.

## Open

| Request | Summary | Priority |
|---------|---------|----------|
| [`table-hidden-in-popin`](table-hidden-in-popin/) | **IMPLEMENTED on branch `claude/ai-demokit-edge-cases-ftv30b`, pending upstream merge** (folder kept until merged). Whitelist `setHiddenInPopin` (+ optionally `setContextualWidth`) in `CONTROL_METHODS`, like the `openBy`/`setActivePage`/`toggleBy` family, so the auto-pop-in demo's MultiComboBox works. From app 092 (now wired). `setContextualWidth`/Slider `setWidth` still open. | medium |
| [`popover-bind-element`](popover-bind-element/) | **IMPLEMENTED on branch `claude/ai-demokit-edge-cases-ftv30b`, pending upstream merge** (folder kept until merged). A `BIND_ELEMENT` `follow_up_action` (popup + popover) — `follow_up_action( val = cs_event-bind_element, view = popup/popover, t_arg = ( idx ) ( client->_bind( mt_tab ) ) )`. The binding comes from `_bind` (registered + rename-safe), never text; the action strips `{ }`, appends `/idx` and sets the slot's element binding. Fits the existing signature, no new method params. Enhancement (app 094, now wired). | medium |
| [`menu-item-selected-path`](menu-item-selected-path/) | A resolvable payload for the selected menu item's ancestor-text breadcrumb (`Create New Site > Official Store`), or a documented capability boundary. From b07 apps 060/061; today only the leaf `${$parameters>/item/text}` is transportable. **Deferred** (2026-07-20, user decision) — cosmetic (toast text) and likely resolves as a documented boundary rather than a framework change; kept for a later call | low — deferred |

## Declined / deferred (folder removed 2026-07-19)

| Request | Decision |
|---------|----------|
| urlhelper-abap-api | **Withdrawn 2026-07-22 — the premise was wrong.** The `URLHELPER` frontend action *is* callable from ABAP: `cs_event-urlhelper` with `TRIGGER_TEL`/`TRIGGER_SMS` (number as a plain string param) and `TRIGGER_EMAIL`/`REDIRECT` (a `{ EMAIL/URL, … }` object-literal `t_arg` — `get_t_arg` emits `{`-prefixed args raw as UI5 event-handler object literals). App 084 ported 1:1 this way; apps 041/073's external links switched from the (same-origin-only) `open_new_tab` to `urlhelper` REDIRECT. Captured as a CAPABILITIES.md convention instead of a framework change |
| named-json-models | **Too complicated with the current abap2UI5 approach** — every view slot serializes exactly one ABAP-fed default JSONModel per roundtrip; a second named model would have to be carried through bind, serialization and model-update on every slot. Declined for now, possibly worth re-discussing in the future if the model layer changes. Workaround stays: flatten into the default model or resolve statically (IMPROVISED deviation, apps 006/031/046, same family app 044) |
| message-manager-binding | **Half already covered, half implemented** — first recorded (b07) as "not filed, already covered": reading messages IS covered by the `message>` auto-collection (2026-07-18) and the plain-table MessagePopover (app 038). But porting `MessagePopoverMessageHandling` (b08) showed the **write** half — the controller's `MessageManager.addMessages` with custom text/target — was not expressible. Implemented 2026-07-20 as the `z2ui5.cc.MessageManager` companion control (see Implemented table) |

## Implemented (folders removed 2026-07-19)

| Request | Implemented | Upstream result |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| control-call-whitelist | 2026-07-18 | `open`, `close`, `setExpanded` added to the `CONTROL_BY_ID` whitelist (`app/webapp/core/FrontendAction.js` `CONTROL_METHODS`); ports 469/471 converted, IMPROVISED deviations dropped. 2026-07-19: the interim `control_call`/`control_call_by_id` wrapper methods were consolidated into `follow_up_action` + `cs_event-control_global`/`control_by_id` |
| message-box-dependent-on | 2026-07-17 | `message_box_display` carries `dependenton`/`contentwidth`; the client resolves the id to a `sap.ui.core.Element` before `MessageBox.show` |
| device-model-in-popups | 2026-07-17 | the shared `device>` model is bound on every view slot at creation — popup, popover and nested views, not just the main view |
| formatter-registry | 2026-07-18 | curated formatter module in the standard app layout (`app/webapp/model/formatter.js`, a served script, CSP-clean) — an eval-based `register_formatter` was implemented and reverted the same day for security |
| formatter-demokit-pack | 2026-07-18 | six suffixed demo kit formatters shipped in the curated module (`weightStateByValue`, `stockStatusState`/`Icon`, `round2DP`, `dimensions`, `deliveryStatusState`); beta sample `z2ui5_cl_demo_app_453` |
| binding-call | 2026-07-18 | declarative filter/sort on aggregation bindings via `cs_event-binding_call` (whitelisted methods/operators, built from data); beta samples `z2ui5_cl_demo_app_454`/`_455`. 2026-07-19: the interim `binding_call_by_id` wrapper method was consolidated into `follow_up_action` + `cs_event-binding_call` |
| message-model | 2026-07-18 | every view slot carries the central UI5 message model as `message>` with `handleValidation` registration; beta sample `z2ui5_cl_demo_app_458` |
| control-method-args | 2026-07-19 | `to` takes an optional transitionName, `open` an optional page key, `goToStep: [controlId, bool]` whitelisted; `castArgs` no longer pads missing trailing args (open() stays no-arg, no NaN ints). Found by hold-out probe #1 (apps 609/624/625) |
| control-methods-openby-setactivepage | 2026-07-20 | new `domRef` arg kind (control id → DOM element, control fallback) + `openBy: [domRef]` (unblocks app 016's hidden DatePicker; covers the TimePicker/Menu anchored-open family) and `setActivePage: [controlId]`. Found by batch b05 (apps 016/012). Note: 536's Carousel re-sync stays dropped — template-clone page ids are not backend-addressable; an index-based page resolution would be a new request if more samples need it |
| binding-call-compound-filters | 2026-07-20 | `BINDING_CALL` `filter` accepts a JSON groups payload — OR inside each group, AND across groups, operators whitelisted, empty clears; the positional single-filter form is unchanged (a path can never start with `[`). Port 401 converted to the compound form — the ABAP-side model rebuild and its `t_products_all` mirror are gone |
| tree-expand-collapse | 2026-07-20 | `expandToLevel: ["int"]` and `collapseAll: []` added to the `CONTROL_BY_ID` whitelist (`app/webapp/core/FrontendAction.js` `CONTROL_METHODS`) for `sap.m.Tree` / `sap.ui.table.TreeTable`; the overview app's tree gains client-side Expand-all / Collapse-all buttons via `_event_client( cs_event-control_by_id … )` |
| menu-toggle-openby | 2026-07-20 | `toggleBy: ["domRef"]` added to `CONTROL_METHODS` — like `openBy`, but `control.isOpen() ? close() : openBy(anchor)`, so a press-to-toggle popup (`sap.m.Menu`) round-trips 1:1 without the backend mirroring open state. Unit tests added; b07 app 060 converted (openBy → toggleBy), IMPROVISED toggle-reduction dropped |
| message-manager-write (z2ui5.cc.MessageManager) | 2026-07-20 | new companion control `app/webapp/cc/MessageManager.js` bridging the UI5 message manager to a two-way bound ABAP table (`items`): app-authored rows are reconciled into the manager as `sap.ui.core.message.Message` (target + view model as processor → field valueState), the control's own rows removed when gone, auto-collected validation left untouched. Mirrors the MultiInputExt pattern; unit-tested; in the preload. Unblocks b08 app 065 (`MessagePopoverMessageHandling`) |
| formatter-inline-icon | 2026-07-20 | `expandInlineIcons(text)` added to the curated `model/formatter.js`: replaces `%%icon:sap-icon://<name>%%` placeholders with the `sapMMsgStripInlineIcon` markup (glyph via `IconPool`), the `MessageStripUtilities.getInlineIcon` equivalent — CSP-clean, no ABAP API. Unit tests added; b07 app 062's inlineIconsHelper converted (placeholders + `core:require` formatter binding), guessed-codepoint IMPROVISED dropped |

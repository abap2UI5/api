# Running the ports locally (real app in your browser)

The ports are ABAP apps. With the abap2UI5 transpiler they run on a **Node
backend** (open-abap runtime + express), so you can start any port and click
through it in a normal browser — no SAP system needed.

## Prerequisites (once)

- An **abap2UI5 checkout** next to this repo (`../abap2UI5`), or point at it with
  `A2UI5_HOME`. Install its deps there once:
  ```sh
  cd ../abap2UI5 && npm ci && cd -
  ```
- This repo's deps: `npm ci`.

## Build + start

```sh
# 1. transpile the framework + all ports into the backend (a few minutes)
npm run e2e:build

# 2. start the Node backend on http://localhost:3000
npm run e2e:serve            #  == node <abap2UI5>/node/srv/express.mjs
```

## Open a port in the browser

Start any port via the `?app_start=<class>` query parameter:

```
http://localhost:3000/?app_start=z2ui5_cl_ai_app_005     # Button
http://localhost:3000/?app_start=z2ui5_cl_ai_app_060     # Menu
http://localhost:3000/?app_start=z2ui5_cl_ai_app_092     # TableAutoPopin
```

The class name is `z2ui5_cl_ai_app_<NNN>` — see `meta/` or the overview app for
the list. UI5 itself loads from the public CDN (`sdk.openui5.org`), so this
needs internet access on your machine (the CI sandbox blocks it, which is why
`npm run e2e` routes UI5 to the local `@openui5` packages instead).

## Automated smoke over every port

```sh
npm run e2e                  # boots each port headless, asserts boot+render+no-error
```

See `scripts/e2e-build.mjs` / `scripts/e2e-smoke.mjs` for details, and AGENTS.md
(`e2e_smoke` gate) for where it fits among the checks.
